<h1>History of Hong Kong</h1>
<h2>
  British Hong Kong
</h2>

<p>
  British merchants began to settle in Hong Kong in 1821. After the first opium
  war, lasting from 1839-1842, Hong Kong was ceded to the British by the treaty
  of nanjing “By the Convention of 1898, the New Territories together with 235
  islands were leased to Britain for 99 years from July 1, 1898.” 100 years of
  British rule left the Hong Kong populous ready to govern themselves and their
  laws. source:

      has many foreign influences in terms of business, trade, and tourism. March 2019- government proposes bill to allow extradition to mainland China
