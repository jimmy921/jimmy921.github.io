<h3>Tiananmen Square Massacre (1989)</h3>
<p>
  Commonly known as the June Fourth incident. It was a student-led protest for
  more democracy in China, end corruption and gain freedom of speech. Armed
  troops swept in with tanks and they shot at protesters and anyone getting in
  their way. This affected everyone at the time, including Chinese enemies and
  allies who did comment on this event.
