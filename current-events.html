    <h4>
      Covid Regulation rules banned Large crowds to gather, 
      this stopped majority of the protests for a period of time. The Corona virus outbreak 
      finally gave China a legal reason to arrest the people of Hong Kong and 
      they used it to its full extent.“social-distancing rules and restrictions on gatherings. 
      Protesters were back on the streets in May but were often quickly dispersed by more 
      forceful police action.”

    <h4>
    Chineses Security bill was passed on June 30th 2020; It essentially gives China the 
    powers to shape life in Hong Kong it has never had before. Critics say it effectively 
    curtails protest and freedom of speech.

    <h2 style="color:blue;"> How this affects the world</h2>
      <h4>
        Chinese government can label anyone a threat against the government.
Because of the law YOU can be arrested if you go to China if you have a history 
of spreading pro hong kong independence speech. The Chinese government are masters of silencing the media,
they are able to force major news corporations and important people in the NBA to not spread awareness about the Hong Kong crisis
and Uyghur muslims concentration camps.
